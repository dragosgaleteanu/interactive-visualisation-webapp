# Navigation
On the top of the site the user will see a header. In this header the name of the site is present on the left and on the right the user sees two buttons which each show a pop-up.
The first button shows the names of the people that worked on the site and the second pop-up shows the video that is made to explain our project. Both pop-ups can be closed with the 
x on the right top corner. When the pop-ups are opened the user cannot click on anything else in the site.

The site will display the file name when it is uploaded and otherwise display the “No file chosen yet.” message. Next to this button are two additional buttons, 
the “READ CSV” and the “VISUALIZE” button. After a file is uploaded, the user can click the “READ CSV” button to have the site display the contents of the file in a table. 
Additionally, the user can click on the “VISUALIZE” button to access a new page, where the visualizations of the file are.

When the “VISUALIZE” button is clicked the user is taken to the next page of the site where the visualisations are given. Here the user can interact with the visualisation by using the 
toolbox given on the right side of the network graph and the chord diagram and on the top of the bar charts.
Explanations for the functions of the toolbox:
Panning: All visualizations provide the option to pan through the figure. This can be done by left-clicking and dragging through the figure. 
         With this, the user can focus more on individual parts of the visualization which they want to take a closer look at.
Zooming: The user can use the mousescroll within the figure to zoom in and out. The user can also use box-zoom, where they can select a certain part of the visualization by left clicking 
         and dragging a box over the figure. 
Tapping: The user can tap a node or bar to highlight it.
Selecting: The user can select several bars by box-selecting the same way as the box-zoom. The same holds for selecting nodes in the chord diagram and the network graph.
Hover: The user can hover over the nodes in the chord diagram and network graph to highlight the traffic from that node and to see the index.
Reset: After zooming/selecting figures the user can reset it with the reset function, where it return to its initial state.

When it is unclear which feature is which in the toolbar next to the visualizations, the user can hover over each feature after which it shows the name of the feature, which will make it 
more clear.

In the visualization page, as seen in figure 3, the same header can be seen at the top along with the name of the site in bold letters below. 
On this page, there is only one additional button, which is the “REVISUALIZE” button. This button takes the user back to the previous page, where they can once again, 
upload, and read .csv files.
